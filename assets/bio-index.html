          have to say: sales leader, marketing professional, IBM product
          expert, technical operations, and analytical competence. As a
          candidate with over 20 years of professional high-value IBM
          business development, I have distinguished myself above other
          candidates by my unrelenting focus on client service, and
          commitment to increasing company profits. In fact, my
          background includes numerous awards and recognition.</font><br>

      IBM recognizes the importance of military service, and because of
      their willingness to grant me on-leave time, I was able to serve
      my country in several key areas. <br>
      <br>
      I recently returned from participation in Operation Atlantic
      Resolve; a contingency operation meant to strengthen partnerships
      with our NATO allies; develop interoperability between
      multinational forces and deter foreign aggression in Eastern
      Europe.<br>
