        <p>If had to describe myself with just a few adjectives I would
          have to say: sales leader, marketing professional, IBM product
          expert, technical operations, and analytical competence. As a
          candidate with over 20 years of professional high-value IBM
          business development, I have distinguished myself above other
          candidates by my unrelenting focus on client service, and
          commitment to increasing company profits. In fact, my
          background includes numerous awards and recognition.<br>
          <br>
          IBM recognizes the importance of military service, and because
          of their willingness to grant me on-leave time, I was able to
          serve my country in several key areas.  I recently returned from participation in Operation Atlantic
          Resolve; a contingency operation meant to strengthen
          partnerships with our NATO allies; develop inter-operability
          between multinational forces and deter foreign aggression in
          Eastern Europe.
